			<h1> About </h1>
			<div id="menu">
			<h3> General </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This is a 9"x12" watercolor on Arches 140lb cold press 100% cotton rag circa 2015.
				</p>

			</div>
			<h3> The Process </h3>
			<div>
				<p>In creating this piece I started with what I would call meaningful doodling where I sketch the lines on some scratch paper to see if there's an image that I could find particular meaningful. The loops at the bottom right came first and the rest of the lines proceeded from there. I used two resists to create this, the first to block out the main image and paint the background, the second to mask the lines to leave them white.</p> 

			</div>
			<h3> The Meaning </h3>
			<div>
				<p>When I was creating this a felt some trepidation as if I was embarking on something taboo. It invoked the idea of the third eye and the three circular loops at toward the center of the triangle were like lines of energy flowing into then out of it and up in undulating waves. I was looking very closely when I saw it as a third eye but when I step back I gain a bigger perspective: there's someone meditating there, their legs obviously crossed and with the lines glowing as they are this is a very deep meditation indeed. My feeling is that the person meditating is me, I often feel some active energy when I do although perhaps not so dramatic as this painting. </p>
				</br>
				<p>I have found good insight from other people on my pieces, and in this case my mother mentioned the word restoration due to the blue of the piece. So here I sit meditating and the energies are rising. As I reach a state of peace the damages of the past are healed and I am restored.</p>
