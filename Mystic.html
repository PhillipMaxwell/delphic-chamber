			<h3> General </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This is a 9"x12" watercolor on Arches 140lb cold press 100% cotton rag paper circa 2008.
				</p>

			</div>
			<h3> The Process </h3>
			<div>
				<p>I came up with the idea for this probably 2 years 
					before finishing it while experimenting with oil 
					paint. So here’s the scene: I got some canvas in 
					front of me and I’m experimenting with acrylics(it
					could have been oil paints, my memory is hazy on
					this point but this is not important in the 
					slightest). I was in a pretty good mood and 
					singing, “Get down! Get down! Get down and boogie!” 
					and other such disco lyrics while chair dancing. I 
					went to clean off the brush on a white tee shirt I 
					designated cleaning rag and in a fit of creativity 
					painted an image very similar to this painting. But 
					I wasn’t ready to make it into a watercolor, and 
					didn’t even realize anything was there, it had to 
					wait probably a good six months before I did 
					anything with it. It was at that point that I was 
					looking at this rag with it’s pretty splotches of 
					color this way and that drew in my eye, all the 
					colors were a bit mesmerizing and realized that 
					there was a darn good idea ready to be mined so I 
					set about drawing a frame work. The frame work went 
					quickly then came masking it which was challenging 
					because I had to use masking fluid on most of it (
					it was all I knew at the time) But after all that 
					preparation it sat for a good many months before 
					completing it. And the piece of what looks like 
					gnarled wood on the right? Not even part of the 
					initial frame work, thrown in at the last minute 
					because I thought there needed to be something 
					there due to the blank space. It turns out that it 
					wasn’t entirely necessary but I’m glad it’s in the 
					piece because it is symbolically significant.</p>

			<h3> The Meaning Part 1</h3>
			<div>
				<p> Well lets start with the stump: the only thing 
					here that doesnt look clean, clear and pristine. 
					I show a lot of my pieces to my mom and she had 
					this to say about it: trial. So the piece has all 
					kinds of inspiring spiritual dimensions to access 
					but before I can access it trial must be faced and 
					this means dealing with your own dark side weather 
					that be anger, resentment, fear, hate, jealousy, 
					entitlement you name it, to some extent or the 
					other you do not pass go, do not collect $200 
					before taking out the trash. And the rest… Well in 
					it you see various sections of “the mountain” and 
					yet it is not entirely a mountain at all! The 
					sections are like realms each one being like 
					another plane of existence. </p>
			</div>
			<h3> The Meaning Part 2</h3>
			<div>
				<p>To start, there is the region floating just over 
					the rolling hills that is a dark indigo. This is a 
					place of great mystery and wonderment but can be 
					quite perilous if you have not yet dealt properly 
					with the stump. Things on this plain are seen as 
					powerful menacing and brutal when the stump is not 
					properly dealt with but the beings here are really 
					angels in disguise and simply want to assist in 
					lightening the psychological load. There is much 
					of faith in this realm and so long as you have it 
					you will always find relief but indulge in your 
					fears and they will become manifest for you. The 
					key to this realm is meditation as nothing you do 
					to lighten the load can be forced. If you force 
					the issue then the situation gets worse, but relax 
					and let the servants of this realm get to work and 
					they will take from you what you don’t need as you 
					let it go. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3> The Meaning Part 3</h3>
			<div>
				<p>There are two sections directly above this 
					separated by what I might call a white flame, the 
					section on the left and the section on the right. 
					The right section is a realm of simple movement 
					and the folks there teach you how to move so as to 
					be fully focused on that movement and nothing else.
					Plow the field harvest grain, go about your daily 
					business all the while forgetting about yesterday 
					and not concerning yourself tomorrow, every 
					movement is an end to itself. The beings here are 
					masters of the principle chop wood, carry water 
					and are here to model that for you. The section to 
					the left counterbalances this with insight. 
					Relaxed and receptive this side represents many 
					different planes of ideas that may come to a person
					. There is a plane of technological innovation, a 
					plane of spiritual insight in action, a plane of 
					spiritual insight in reflection, a plane of 
					complex solutions, and a plane of simple solutions 
					. The white flame between is the point of 
					stillness out of which all the planes arise.
				</p> 
			</div>
			<h3> The Meaning Part 4</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The figure above that is a man his large head 
					showing that he has a high degree of mastery. The 
					thin path that attaches to his torso is a thread, 
					and it connects to another realm which is our 
					realm, the realm of the day to day world. He is a 
					guide and has synthesized the wisdom of all the 
					realms in his head and leads you to a place of 
					vast knowledge and understanding of all the realms.
