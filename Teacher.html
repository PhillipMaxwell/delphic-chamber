			<h1> About </h1>
			<div id="menu">
			<h3> General </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This is a 9”x12” Watercolor on Arches 140lb Cold Press 100% cotton rag circa 2014.
				</p>

			</div>
			<h3> The Process </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This piece was not so difficult to finish: finding it proceeded effortlessly and I didn’t labor too long determining the coloring. This was the first time I decided to see if I could color the lines and keep a luminous look partially because I like to experiment and see what new things I can do (which can also lead to conceptually hard to complete pieces). This is probably one of my favorite color combinations especially with the yellow: the only color you can paint and still have a lot of remaining brightness.</p> 

			</div>
			<h3> The Meaning </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This looks like a spiritual teacher along the lines of Buddha or Jesus or Lao Tzu. Here’s the thing with this teacher: firstly they are waiting open arms to show affection for their students (such as hugs) secondly they don’t have much of an attachment to the title teacher. So they are more than happy to share their boundless knowledge with the student but they don’t care about formalities or even student/teacher roles. They are just as interested in learning everything they can from you as you might be interested in learning from them. Nothing would make them happier than if you were every bit the teacher to them as they are to you.</p>
