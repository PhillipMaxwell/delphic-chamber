			<h1> About </h1>
			<div id="menu">
			<h3> General </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This is a 9”x12” Watercolor on Arches 140lb Cold Press 100% cotton rag circa 2015.

			<h3> The Process </h3>
			<div>
				<p>his piece proceeded fairly simply as I was conducting more meaningful doodling I stumbled upon this image and found it rather meaningful. I had the sketch for this sitting on notebook paper for a few months before I decided to do anything with it. Once I had it on notebook paper and the subject masked out it took me a few days to settle on the background. Firstly I like sunrise and sunset colors so I googled sunsets to search for one that would give me color ideas to use. Secondly I decided to do something different from the work before and depict the light as I'd seen in the sunset as if it were peeking through the cloud. Once I had a good idea I set about painting the background. Painting the background was easy though. When I pulled up the tape and the gelled up resist fluid I was reminded of the complexity of the lines below it. I weighed alot of different options before I choose what is finished and this took alot of time to contemplate. Fear of messing up the piece though still got in the way of finishing it, and I was 1/3rd finished with the central figure then shelved it for six more months before finishing it.</p>

			<h3> The Meaning </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This piece looks to me like a person spinning their own bodies energies around. If you practice yoga you might call it prana and of course if you practice Tai Chi or some other martial art you might call it chi. Their activity isn’t just a moving through the forms though but rather a joyful dance as they move the energies this way and that all the while containing and focusing the chi. The yellow speaks of hope, optimism and joy, the red speaks of passion and the violet speaks of spiritual intent. This person is spinning this way and that, spreading joy wherever they go</p>
