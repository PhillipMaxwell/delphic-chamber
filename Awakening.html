			<h3> General </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This is a 9"x12" watercolor on Strathmore 140lb cold press paper using Crayola Watercolor. Circa 2002.
				</p>

			</div>
			<h3> The Process </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This piece was fairly early in my artistic exploration and I was actually using Crayola watercolor for the large majority of the piece. I only had one brush, the brush that came with the Crayola set so this piece took quite a long time to finish, 15 hours approximately. Rather than going on thinly like you would normally expect for watercolor, the paint went on thickly to give the dark color. I would not likely ever sell the original given the nature of the media: Crayola puts a detergent along with excessive gum arabic in their watercolor which is great for keeping it from staining surfaces it makes it less than ideal for permanency thus a print is likely going to be much more permanent than the original.</p> 

			</div>
			<h3> The Meaning </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This piece is fairly straight forward as it was inspired by an unrequited love interest. It was a very sad period for me because I thought I found a girl that was 
				<span> The One </span> 
				and yet 
				<span> The One </span> 
				didn't seem to want anything to do with me. This piece is symbolic of me figuring out that nothing was going to happen between the two of us. The upshot of all of this is that this piece was quite cathartic to finish and helped me come to terms with the truth.
