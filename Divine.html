			<h3> General </h3>
			<div>
				<p>This is a 9"x12" watercolor on Strathmore 140lb cold press paper Circa 2004.
				</p>

			</div>
			<h3> The Process </h3>
			<div>
				<p>I painted this piece very shortly after seeing Sarah McLachlan's Afterglow concert at Key Arena. I remember dying and going to heaven several times during that concert (probably at least 20) so suffice to say I was full of inspiration. I got home from the show and saw a collection of images on watercolor and one of them was the main figure in this piece. It was at this point that I realized I was coming up with many disjointed ideas and that I could take one idea and focus on it solely to create a good composition. Back then as now I prefer not to show brush strokes so I was initially dissatisfied with what looked like wrinkles in the background but I later found that the effect worked and fit nicely with the piece. This was of course in the days before masking so I painted the main images first then the background which is far easier than the process of masking the main images so you can try to figure out what color you want the background before the image is complete but so it goes.</p>

			<h3> The Meaning </h3>
			<div>
				<p> I always thought the meaning of this piece was pretty straight forward, a butterfly emerges from the cocoon. I will say that I thought I was the butterfly so it was as if I was in the process of going through a transformation. The flames are part of the transformation as they burn of all the old remnants that no longer serve a purpose. The infinity symbol suggests a moment that stretches on forever, so you are not finished with that transformation until you are at peace with each moment of transformation. I always thought of the cross in the background as a star but then likened to a divine witness although I did have this insight from my mother: it represents more trial; this transformation isnâ€™t going to be easy as you will have many challenges to face before it is complete.
